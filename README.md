# hello-world
first repo on github

Hello, I am mpswong and this is my foray into GitHub and storing my code publicly.  I am primarily interested in data science, but also Python in general.  I appreciate the generosity of the community in putting so much code out there for beginners like me to learn from.

I currently live in Calgary, Canada where I work as an applications engineer in the drinking water industry.  I try to incorporate code-based solutions in my day job to make it a bit more interesting.
