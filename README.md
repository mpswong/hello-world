# hello-world
first repo on github

Hello, I am mpswong and this is my foray into GitHub and storing my code publicly.  I am primarily interested in data science, but also Python in general.  I appreciate the generosity of the community in putting so much code out there for beginners like me to learn from.

I currently live in Calgary, Canada.
