# hello-world
first repo on github

Hello, I am mpswong and this is my first time using a GitHub account.  I have looked at a lot of other peoples' code here and have set this up to create a portfolio of my work, and frankly just to remember what I have learned.

I currently live in Calgary, Canada.
